# TopContributors

A website to thank every PrestaShop contributors.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

To generate the required `contributors.js` use **traces** project:

```
composer create-project prestashop/traces
./traces/traces -u <GitHubLogin> -p <GitHubPassword> -o PrestaShop --config="./traces/config.dist.yml"
```

Then place the file `contributors.js` into the folder named `static`.

## Docker

Added to this repository is a Dockerfile easing up the image build.

It realies heavily on the [docker multi-stage](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) feature, in order to provide a clean image for the run.

It also uses the [build arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg) feature in order to only provide the github credentials during the command line **build**:

```
docker build --no-cache -t top-contributors --build-arg USER_LOGIN={{GITHUB_USER}} --build-arg USER_PASS={{GITHUB_PASSWORD}} -f Dockerfile .
```

Where :

- GITHUB_USER: is the user that will be passed to retrieve the repository informations.

- GITHUB_PASSWORD: is either a token or your github user password, to authenticate with github.

Please advise that with Two Factor Authentication currently being activated, the password authentication method will likely fail and using a token is much preferable.

Then, if you want to locally **run** this image:

```
docker run -p 80:80 top-contributors
```

## Deployment

The development branch is `develop`. Code changes should be merged inside `develop` using Pull Requests.

When you want to deploy latest changes to production environment contributors.prestashop-project.org ;


- open then merge a Pull Request merging branch `develop` inside `main` ([example](https://github.com/PrestaShop/TopContributors/pull/105))
- then publish a GitHub release to trigger the deployment of the production environment
